### Tools 
- Numpy
- pandas
- skilearn 
- matplot
- tensor flow

## AI vs ML vs Neural Network 

AI > ML > Neural Networks 

### AI 
- Predefined set of rules
  - Hardcoded 

### ML 
- Generates the rules for us looking at data
- Aim
  - Increase rules

### Neural Networks / Deep learning 
- Subset of ML
  - With multiple layers of information 

___
### Data 
- Divided into features and labels
#### Features
- Input data 
- For making the model

#### Labels 
- Output information 

Feature -> Model = Labels 

____

Tensor Flow 

Data types 
- Strings - tf.string 
- numbers 
- Floating 

Scaler and Vector 
Rank 
- Number of nested lists in Python 
- Rank 1
  - ["ooo"]
- Rank 2 
  - [["hell"],["oo"]]
  
Shape 
- Number of elements in each dimension
  - ["1","2"] => (2) (Highest Dimension, further Elements, Individual Elements)


Reshape
- Present same information in different way 
- ["1","2"] => [["1"],["2"]] 
  - We reshaped (2,) to (2, 1)


### Type of Tensors
Everything is immutable except
- Variable 
  - Is mutable 
- Constants 
- Placeholder 
- SparseTensor

___
### Core Algorithms 

- Linear Regression 
- Classification 
- Clustering 
- Hidden Markov Models
  

#### Linear Regression 
- Line of best fit in **any** dimension
- Why Choose linear regression ? 
  - Dataset are related linearly
    - How do we test it ?
      - Graphs
