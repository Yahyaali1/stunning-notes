### Why functional programming 


- Declarative
  - Less time spend into understanding the code
  - Has mathematical proofs 

Procedure
- steps of functions
- 

Functions
- Takes input(s) and returns output(s) 
- Function is function if it calls another function. If it calls procedure it turns into procedure itself.
- Naming semantics
  - **Describe relationship between input and output** 
- Avoid side effects
  - input and outputs should be direct. 
  - eg update a variable that is not part of input
  - I/O, storage, timestamps
-
